#                Genetic Algorithm made by Xu Han && Lin Xu
##  This project is aim to know how Chromosome changed and after adjust fitness, what is every Generation's best chromosome and current chromosome. By check function value we can find that the difference between best and current. 

##  Steps of the genetic Algorithm:
####    Initialization
####    Evolution
###       Selection
###       Crossover
###       Mutation
###       Evaluation


##  Difference from other normal genetic algorthms:
####   Using multithread during the mutating process
####   Use BigDecimal rather than double to maintain and scale the loss of the accurate
